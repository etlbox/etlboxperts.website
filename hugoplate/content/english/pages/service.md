{{< accordion "What is Test-driven development (TDD)?" >}}

TDD is a software development process where the developer first writes an automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test, and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards.

**Key Principles of TDD**:
- Short Development Cycles: The idea is to write small tests and small pieces of code iteratively. This helps in catching issues early and reduces the need for extensive debugging later.
- **Red-Green-Refactor**: This mantra describes the TDD process. Red - write a failing test, Green - make the test pass, Refactor - clean up the code while maintaining functionality.
- **Focus on User Requirements**: TDD requires writing tests based on user requirements, ensuring the development process stays focused on delivering what's actually needed.

**Benefits of TDD**:
- **Improved Code Quality**: Since tests are written first, TDD often leads to better-designed, cleaner, and more reliable code.
- **Early Bug Detection**: Issues are typically caught early in the development cycle, reducing the cost and effort of fixing them later.
- **Enhanced Documentation**: The tests serve as documentation of the codebase, making it easier for new developers to understand the functionality of the system.
- **Confidence in Refactoring**: The comprehensive suite of tests allows developers to refactor code with confidence, knowing that any regression will be caught by the tests.


{{< /accordion >}}

{{< accordion "Why is TDD So Important?" >}}

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is crucial for several reasons, impacting the design, quality, and maintainability of software. Below are the key aspects of TDD's importance:
