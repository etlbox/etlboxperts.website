{{< accordion "What is a Data Warehouse?" >}}

A Data Warehouse (DWH) is a centralized repository designed to store integrated data from multiple sources. It is a foundational component of business intelligence and plays a crucial role in data-driven decision-making. The key characteristics and functions of a Data Warehouse include:

1. **Integration of Data**: DWHs consolidate data from various sources, such as transactional databases, CRM systems, and other operational software. This integration enables a unified view of information, essential for comprehensive analysis and reporting.

2. **Subject-Oriented**: Unlike operational systems that focus on specific business processes (like sales, finance, or marketing), a Data Warehouse is organized around key subjects such as customer, product, or sales. This organization helps in analyzing data across different segments of the business.

3. **Time-Variant**: Data in a DWH is stored with a time dimension, meaning historical data is kept for analysis over time. This aspect is crucial for identifying trends, patterns, and long-term performance analysis.

4. **Non-Volatile**: Once data is entered into the DWH, it is not changed or deleted. This ensures the consistency of historical data, which is vital for accurate trend analysis and forecasting.

5. **Performance and Scalability**: Data Warehouses are optimized for reading, aggregating, and querying large sets of data. They are designed to handle complex queries and deliver fast performance while scaling to accommodate growing data volumes.
